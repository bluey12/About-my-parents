        <p id="p"><Strong><b>My Dad(what is a <b>Film Director</b>)</b></Strong><br><br>A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script)<br> while guiding the film crew and actors in the fulfilment of that vision. The director has a key role in<br> choosing the cast members, production design and all the creative aspects of filmmaking.[1] Under European<br> Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.[2]<br>

            The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film<br> eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions <br>and stay within the budget.<br>
            
            There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters,<br> cinematographers, producers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school.<br> Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue,<br> while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some<br> directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing<br> partners. Other directors edit or appear in their films or compose the music score for their films.[3]</p><br><br>
